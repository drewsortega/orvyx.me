# Projects
## ORTSOC Infrastructure (Senior Capstone)
- Designed a Security Operations Center (SOC) Infrastructure for data ingestion and analysis of client security events
- Wrote Ansible Playbooks with YAML and Jinja2 Templating Engine to standardize and automate deployment and updates
- Set up hardware running several drives and blades running within the Oregon State University Network, with its own firewall, pfsense, and VMWare Instance.
- Deployed Data analysis tools using the Elastic Stack with software like Elastic, Kibana, and Logstash.
- Secured data trasfer between clients and the ORTSOC using Wireguard VPN.

## lineage
Lightweight TCP Socket wrapper library, written in Rust. Accepts hardware-limited number of connections to be used for both clients and servers. Operates multi-threaded over custom-implemented pool and communicates over generalized packets serialized between devices.

## osborne 
Application which uses provided user coordinates and elevation, along with the USGS national elevation raster data, to help firefters find the location of smoke or fire from a vantage point.

## pushpipe 
Small package on npmjs.org which makes receiving data on streams after using pipes easier.

## FPGA Floyd-Steinberg Dithering
A parallelized and pipelined implementation of Floyd-Steinberg Dithering that intercepts HDMI input and applies the filter to direct HDMI output in 60 frames per second on an FPGA using High-Level Synthesis and Xilinx ZCU102.

## Nagini
Zeek log puller and data analyzer for the OSU Security Operations Center.
