# hello! I'm Drew.

I'm currently a 4th year undergraduate student at Oregon State University, where I study computer science with a minor in mathematics.

I grew up in Tigard, OR and attended Tigard High School, which fostered my interests in technology for years to come. My teacher at the time, Steve Fulton, provided opportinuities to learn robotics, take programming classes, and earn modern industry-level IT certificates.

In my free time, I enjoy biking, hiking, and backpacking throughout Oregon and Washington. Some of my favorite spots include the Jefferson Wilderness and the Salmon-Huckleberry Wilderness.
